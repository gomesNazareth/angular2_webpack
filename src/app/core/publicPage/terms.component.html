            <li>does not contain any virus or other similar contaminating or destructive feature.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

            <li> In relation to your Profile Page, you should:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="sub">
            <li>correct your own mistakes as soon as you realize that they have been made; and</li>
            <li>not remove any material that BLOOVO has added to your Profile Page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2.  Potential Employers</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> If you are a potential employer, you will need to register with BLOOVO in order to advertise any Position using the Website. You may register an account with this Website only if your registration has not previously been withdrawn or suspended by BLOOVO.</li>
            <li>The Website will contain a particular page (your “Employer Profile Page”) that contains information and /or pictures and / or videos about you as a potential employer and, from time to time, any Positions that you may wish to fill. You should keep those details as updated as possible.</li>
            <li>BLOOVO offers potential employers the right to place advertising on the Website.  In order to access this facility, potential employers must establish an account (which must be done in accordance with the requirements of BLOOVO at that time) and must keep that account in credit.  BLOOVO will, from time to time, notify potential employers of advertising services that are available by way of a notice on the Website. When a potential employer wishes BLOOVO to undertake a particular advertising service on its behalf, it will supply such details as BLOOVO may require in relation to that advertising service and, subject to the account of the potential employer holding enough funds to pay for that advertising service, BLOOVO will supply that service. All advertising services are provided in accordance with the terms confirmed by BLOOVO at the time of purchase and, together with these terms, will form the basis for the provision of the advertising services. No other document will bind BLOOVO in relation to such advertising services.
                <br>
                All credit balances in these accounts (including any money credited to the account by potential employers because of the operation of the advertising services) cannot be refunded for any reason and those funds should be used within 12 months of the deposit being made or they may be retained by BLOOVO. The deposit of funds with BLOOVO indicates that the potential employer is offering to purchase advertising services from BLOOVO and the potential employer agrees to the terms set out in this clause.

However if you, at any time, because of an error or for any other reason, find that you can access and alter any other part of the Website, you must not alter or add any material of any nature to those information pages. If this occurs, BLOOVO may remove any Positions that you have on the Website at that time, remove your Employer Profile Page and/or terminate your access to the Website.
